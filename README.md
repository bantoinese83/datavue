### Introduction
DataVue is a web-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for uploading CSV files, visualizing the data through automatically generated charts, and deriving actionable insights using OpenAI's powerful AI models. The primary objective of DataVue is to simplify the process of data analysis and insights generation from CSV files, making it accessible to a broader audience, including those without advanced technical skills.

### System Architecture

#### Frontend
The frontend of DataVue is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Context API handles State management, while React Router is used for navigation. Styling is achieved through CSS Modules or Styled Components, ensuring that styles are scoped and maintainable.

#### Backend
The backend is developed using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. User authentication and authorization are secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The application data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, with SQLAlchemy serving as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions. The application also integrates with the OpenAI API for generating insights from the uploaded CSV data.

#### Infrastructure
The application is hosted on a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. Continuous integration and deployment are achieved using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI. Docker is used for creating containerized environments, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different platforms.

### Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, Axios, Chart.js
* **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, python-jose, OpenAI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Deployment:** Docker, Nginx, Gunicorn

### Database Schema

The application's data is stored across three main tables:

* **Users:** Stores user credentials and profile information. Fields include id, username, email, hashed_password, and created_at.
* **Uploads:** Tracks information about uploaded CSV files. Fields include id, filename, user_id, and uploaded_at.
* **Insights:** Records insights generated from CSV data. Fields include id, upload_id, text, and created_at.

### API Design

The application exposes several API endpoints for interacting with the system:

* **Auth:** Handles user registration, login, and token refresh.
* **Uploads:** Manages file uploads and retrieval.
* **Insights:** Generates and retrieves insights based on uploaded CSV data.

All responses are returned in a consistent JSON format for ease of integration.

### Security Considerations

DataVue takes several measures to ensure the security of user data:

* **Authentication:** JWTs are used in conjunction with HTTPS to secure user authentication and data transmission.
* **Input Validation:** Pydantic models are used for rigorous data validation.
* **Password Storage:** Passwords are hashed using bcrypt or similar algorithms for secure storage.
* **CORS:** Cross-origin requests are restricted to trusted domains.

### Development Workflow

The development process follows best practices for version control and code quality:

* **Version Control:** Git is used for source code management, with GitHub serving as the remote repository.
* **Branching Strategy:** A feature branching strategy is used to isolate development work.
* **Code Review:** Pull requests are reviewed before merging to ensure code quality.
* **Testing:** Unit and integration tests are implemented using Pytest for the backend and Jest for the frontend.
* **Documentation:** API documentation is generated using Swagger, and project documentation is maintained in Markdown format.

### Project Timeline

The development of DataVue is divided into four main phases:

* **Phase 1:** Setup and Initial Development
* **Phase 2:** Core Features Development
* **Phase 3:** OpenAI Integration and Enhancement
* **Phase 4:** Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance

### Conclusion

DataVue aims to democratize data analysis by providing an intuitive platform for extracting valuable insights from data. By leveraging modern web technologies and artificial intelligence, DataVue stands to make a significant impact on how data is visualized and interpreted by users across various industries.
